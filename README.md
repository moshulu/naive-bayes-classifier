# naive-bayes-classifier
A simple naive bayes machine learning classifier that predicts the datapoint p(Bad, A, High) given a set of sample data (see documentation).

## Running the program
main.py was programmed in Python3 in Atom on a Windows 10 x64 machine. It was compiled, and tested using modified environment variables using the CLI.

Clone the repository. Then, open a command prompt to the directory you cloned the repository. Type:

```

    python3 main.py

```

It should output something like ![alt text](https://imgur.com/gbWXQP2 "The sample output.")
